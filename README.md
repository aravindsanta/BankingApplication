Banking application
This is the basic banking application, developed by me using the material they taught us at college in first semester. This performs adding funds, withdrawing and showing balance etc. The first prompt is for the user to enter details, followed by their 8 digit account number. Upon successful verification, the user was prompoted to select from 4 options(1. add funds, 2. withdraw, 3. show balance 4. Exit).
When the student adds funds, the program shows the balance and asks the 4 options to enter.
When the student selects option 4, the program exits thanking the user for banking with us.
